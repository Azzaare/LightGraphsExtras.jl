*LightGraphsExtras.jl* contains supplementary functions for [LightGraphs](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl) that
require external packages to function. Currently, the following functionality is supported:

- Matching
- Spectral functions (Combinatorial Adjacencies, based on the [GraphMatrices](https://github.com/jpfairbanks/GraphMatrices.jl) package
- Datasets
- Community detection
- Network Interdiction (flow) using [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl)
