# Community Structures
*LightGraphs.jl* and *LightGraphsExtras.jl* contains many algorithm to detect and analyze community structures
in graphs. Here *LightGraphsExtras.jl* we find:

## community detection
### community_detection_nback
```julia
community_detection_nback(g, k::Int)
```

Community detection using the spectral properties of the non-backtracking matrix of `g` (see [Krzakala et al.](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/52/20935.short)).

`g`: imput Graph `k`: number of communities to detect

return : array containing vertex assignments
